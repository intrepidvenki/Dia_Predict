# Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model built using logistic regression to predict whether a patient is likely to suffer from diabetes symptoms based on their age and other relevant features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains the following features:

- Age
- Gender
- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Sudden weight loss
- Weakness
- Polyphagia
- Genital thrush
- Visual blurring
- Itching
- Irritability
- Delayed healing
- Partial paresis
- Muscle stiffness
- Alopecia
- Obesity

The target variable is the class, indicating whether the patient is positive or negative for diabetes symptoms.

## Model

The model is built using logistic regression. It takes the age of the patient as input and predicts whether the patient is likely to have diabetes symptoms based on the provided data.

## Usage

To use this model:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd dia_predict
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any) using the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the prediction script, providing the age of the patient as input:

   ```
   Run the jupyter notebook
   ```

   Replace `40` with the age of the patient you want to predict.

## Note

This model is trained on a specific dataset and may not generalize well to other datasets or populations. Use it for educational and demonstration purposes only.
